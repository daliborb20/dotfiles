My vimrc configuration

WARNING
=======

This is my config for me, it's on my github account for easy access. Feel free
to use it or get inspired from it but it comes with no guarentee or support so
use it at your own risk.

INSTALLATION
============

Simple run `install.sh` as the user you want to install this config for.

You will also need to install Powerline via Python's pip and add a small section
to your .bash_rc
